Support for jsx, redux, express, uglify and hmr

currently set up for CSS only, but could be changed to support scss

npm run dev-watch for node server and rollup watch
served on 8080

npm run storybook

To create a component branch run buildComponentBranch --dirName=branch name here
should also be noted that this command outputs the branch name as the top level jsx container for the branch
this feature still needs a little work

pros of scoped styling
- compile time errors
- no strict naming conventions or strict layering
